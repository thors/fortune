This repository just contains some files for fortune and some scripts to convert/install them.
Feel free to fork and contribute, I'm collecting free content from wherever I legally can.

Format of the file is

    Some text item
    Maybe multiple lines
    %
    Next item

The script creates a pointer-file using "strfile" and can copy the results (text-file plus pointer-file) to 
/usr/share/games/fortune  (default location on Fedora).
